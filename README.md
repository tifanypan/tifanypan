## Hi there 👋 I'm Tifany Pan

0→1 Product Builder | Ex-Verily/Alphabet, CueIn AI | [Fuyu Labs](https://fuyulabs.com)

I build products fast and understand the systems underneath them. **21 prototypes in 8 months** - currently focused on language learning and multiplayer games.

Also: time analytics tools, fitness trackers, content flow systems, market research automation.
